<p><strong>Kenya August 2015 Trip</strong><br>Jambo! That is a true Swahili hello. What a full month August was for us. We are so very thankful for all of your prayers and support as we prepared for and ministered in Kenya.<br>We started our 14 day journey with our five person team by traveling a little over 25 hours to get to Kenya. The Lord gave grace for all of us as we journeyed and tried to adjust to our new time zone. When we landed in Nairobi we were able to have a night of rest at our hotel and enjoy stretching our legs!<br>The conferences were held western Kenya in an area close to Kisii called Marani and south Central Kenya in Githurai, which is just east of the capital city of Nairobi. We ministered to approximately 100 leaders and pastors between the two cities. There were several denominations and backgrounds that organized and attended the meetings. We gave out certificates of completion to all of the participants that were trained in the seminars. We saw the Lord move powerfully with several healings and strengthened the attendees through the teachings. Here are a few testimonies from the trip:<br>Marani - One woman had been to doctors for problem with her leg that was not moving well with numbness after a stroke. She had pain in her body and breathing problems/asthma. She is able to move her leg regularly and able to breathe normally.<br>- 1 young man had issues breathing. He felt heaviness lift off of his chest and he could breathe easier.<br>At the open air service, we probably had 4000-5000.<br>There were around 200 adults and 300 children that raised their hands and gave their lives to the Lord.<br>Saturday, August 22nd<br>We taught again in Marani. The teachings were studying the Bible, biblical meditation, prayer and unity.<br>One woman had diabetes, weakness in her legs, and very little movement in her right arm. The Lord allowed her to be able to stretch out her hand. She was able to stand more easily and she felt blood flowing through her legs and no more pain in her knees.<br>We prayed for a woman who had a cyst on the top of her wrist. The pain went away and she said she thought she would be able to cancel her surgery that was scheduled. It was no longer tight, reduced in size two times and was able to move around more freely. It was rock hard before and she said it felt like it broke away and became soft.<br>- The Kenyans thought there were between 10-15k people. We had over 1300 people respond to follow Jesus at the meeting.<br>There was a woman that had stomach issues, back pain and leg pain. She came forward for prayer and said she felt better in all of those areas.<br>- Over 20,000 people approximately attended the Marani crusade to hear about Jesus, and approximately 1400-1500 gave their lives to the Lord.<br>Our teachings were on healing, how to study the Bible, biblical finances, unity, discipleship, destiny and more. In both locations we held evangelistic crusades daily where we preached the Gospel and lead people to salvation. We saw around 3,500 people make decisions for Christ and connect to local churches, and there were also 27 documented healings. We will be posting many more pictures on our website and Facebook soon. Your prayers and financial partnership are changing lives for eternity around the world, and may the Lord pour out His blessings upon you richly!<br>We are so blessed to be doing what the Lord has called us to both here and around the world. Thank you for believing in us and joining in the adventure of advancing the Kingdom!</p><article><picture>

<h1>Kenya Trips</h1><p>Jambo! That is a true Swahili hello. What a full month August was for us. We are so very thankful for all of your prayers and support as we prepared for and ministered in Kenya. We started our 14 day journey with our five person team by traveling a little over 25 hours to get to Kenya.</p></article><h3>8.22.13<br>We have made it safely to Nairobi, Kenya. All team members and luggage arrived smoothly, except the obligatory concern when one member's boarding pass was not being granted in Brussels. After multiple help desks and showing paperwork, she was able to board and the last one to enter the plane.

That is a true Swahili hello. What a full month August was for us. We are so very thankful for all of your prayers and support as we prepared for and ministered in Kenya.We started our 14 day journey with our five person team by traveling a little over 25 hours to get to Kenya. The Lord gave grace for all of us as we journeyed and tried to adjust to our new time zone. When we landed in Nairobi we were able to have a night of rest at our hotel and enjoy stretching our legs!The conferences were held western Kenya in an area close to Kisii called Marani and south Central Kenya in Githurai, which is just east of the capital city of Nairobi. We ministered to approximately 100 leaders and pastors between the two cities. There were several denominations and backgrounds that organized and attended the meetings. We gave out certificates of completion to all of the participants that were trained in the seminars. We saw the Lord move powerfully with several healings and strengthened the attendees through the teachings. Here are a few testimonies from the trip:Marani - One woman had been to doctors for problem with her leg that was not moving well with numbness after a stroke. She had pain in her body and breathing problems/asthma. She is able to move her leg regularly and able to breathe normally.- 1 young man had issues breathing. He felt heaviness lift off of his chest and he could breathe easier.At the open air service, we probably had 4000-5000.There were around 200 adults and 300 children that raised their hands and gave their lives to the Lord.Saturday, August 22ndWe taught again in Marani. The teachings were studying the Bible, biblical meditation, prayer and unity.One woman had diabetes, weakness in her legs, and very little movement in her right arm. The Lord allowed her to be able to stretch out her hand. She was able to stand more easily and she felt blood flowing through her legs and no more pain in her knees.We prayed for a woman who had a cyst on the top of her wrist. The pain went away and she said she thought she would be able to cancel her surgery that was scheduled. It was no longer tight, reduced in size two times and was able to move around more freely. It was rock hard before and she said it felt like it broke away and became soft.- The Kenyans thought there were between 10-15k people. We had over 1300 people respond to follow Jesus at the meeting.There was a woman that had stomach issues, back pain and leg pain. She came forward for prayer and said she felt better in all of those areas.- Over 20,000 people approximately attended the Marani crusade to hear about Jesus, and approximately 1400-1500 gave their lives to the Lord.Our teachings were on healing, how to study the Bible, biblical finances, unity, discipleship, destiny and more. In both locations we held evangelistic crusades daily where we preached the Gospel and lead people to salvation. We saw around 3,500 people make decisions for Christ and connect to local churches, and there were also 27 documented healings. We will be posting many more pictures on our website and Facebook soon. Your prayers and financial partnership are changing lives for eternity around the world, and may the Lord pour out His blessings upon you richly!We are so blessed to be doing what the Lord has called us to both here and around the world. Thank you for believing in us and joining in the adventure of advancing the Kingdom!","title":"International Trips","keywords":["healings","lord","pain","prayed","woman","jesus","legs","leigh","meetings","pastor"],"publisher":{"name":"Adam & Kelli Moser","domain":"www.mosersinministry.com","url":"http://www.mosersinministry.com","favicon":"http://www.mosersinministry.com/favicon.ico"}},"content":[{"id":"2349b398-03cb-46b6-a02a-b9fef266613d","item":"84aad65a-4aa5-4187-89da-9d88f7a1c72a","type":"h1","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"International Trips","_html":"<h1>International Trips</h1>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"e116e714-ab31-43d0-97a5-d3dc96ed2b2b","item":"84aad65a-4aa5-4187-89da-9d88f7a1c72a","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/274293f732e6adb14417f015bce68615/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1036d54c0e6d32c42ca7633038ef58b0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"starred":true},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b42b9a4ebe88f936bfc7c51d1bd97a29/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=960"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/274293f732e6adb14417f015bce68615/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1036d54c0e6d32c42ca7633038ef58b0/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7d8a5486-f1c5-4496-88e8-490695b64111.jpg&width=360"}],"resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/0b39961f6705918dc1ac0417f5187f75.png","ratio":"16:9","aspect":1.7777777777777777,"orientation":"landscape","width":960,"height":540,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":256,"y":128,"width":42,"height":42,"confidence":5.019752},{"x":640,"y":166,"width":60,"height":60,"confidence":5.018126},{"x":520,"y":125,"width":53,"height":53,"confidence":5.015323},{"x":424,"y":108,"width":48,"height":48,"confidence":5.014736},{"x":327,"y":107,"width":53,"height":53,"confidence":4.99997}],"colors":[[8,12,13],[252,252,252],[151,165,165],[59,58,54],[110,13,20]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1,90],[959,539]],"confidence":0.206058,"center":[479,407],"radius":510.991},"exif":{"exif":{"image":{"Orientation":1,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"YCbCrPositioning":1,"ExifOffset":102},"thumbnail":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"ThumbnailOffset":286,"ThumbnailLength":7833},"exif":{"ColorSpace":1,"ExifImageWidth":960,"ExifImageHeight":540,"SceneCaptureType":[]},"gps":{},"interoperability":{},"makernote":{}}}}},{"id":"8996ad97-283a-428a-8471-06da5f438809","item":"84aad65a-4aa5-4187-89da-9d88f7a1c72a","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Kenya August 2015 TripJambo!
