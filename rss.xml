            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Give</h1><p>We have 70% of our monthly budget pledged, and we are needing to raise an additional $1000 per month. Those that partner with us in prayer and finances become part of our team. If we had 10 people join us at $100 a month we would be fully financially supported as a couple. No gift is too small, and we are thankful for every donation that we have received. We are over halfway through 2016 and we are hoping to grow our team, which is not just the Plumbline staff, but includes every person that is partnering with us in prayer and finances. If you sense that would like to join our partnership team through prayer or finances, please let us know. Tax-deductible contributions can be made through Plumbline Ministries in multiple ways to help us advance Godâ€™s Kingdom. Give Here </p></article>]]></description>
