  Kenya August 2015 TripJambo! That is a true Swahili hello. What a full month
  August was for us. We are so very thankful for all of your prayers and support
  as we prepared for and ministered in Kenya.We started our 14 day journey with
  our five person team by traveling a little over 25 hours to get to Kenya. The
  Lord gave grace for all of us as we journeyed and tried to adjust to our new
  time zone. When we landed in Nairobi we were able to have a night of rest at
  our hotel and enjoy stretching our legs!The conferences were held western
  Kenya in an area close to Kisii called Marani and south Central Kenya in
  Githurai, which is just east of the capital city of Nairobi. We ministered to
  approximately 100 leaders and pastors between the two cities. There were
  several denominations and backgrounds that organized and attended the
  meetings. We gave out certificates of completion to all of the participants
  that were trained in the seminars. We saw the Lord move powerfully with
  several healings and strengthened the attendees through the teachings. Here
  are a few testimonies from the trip:Marani - One woman had been to doctors for
  problem with her leg that was not moving well with numbness after a stroke.
  She had pain in her body and breathing problems/asthma. She is able to move
  her leg regularly and able to breathe normally.- 1 young man had issues
  breathing. He felt heaviness lift off of his chest and he could breathe
  easier.At the open air service, we probably had 4000-5000.There were around
  200 adults and 300 children that raised their hands and gave their lives to
  the Lord.Saturday, August 22ndWe taught again in Marani. The teachings were
  studying the Bible, biblical meditation, prayer and unity.One woman had
  diabetes, weakness in her legs, and very little movement in her right arm. The
  Lord allowed her to be able to stretch out her hand. She was able to stand
  more easily and she felt blood flowing through her legs and no more pain in
  her knees.We prayed for a woman who had a cyst on the top of her wrist. The
  pain went away and she said she thought she would be able to cancel her
  surgery that was scheduled. It was no longer tight, reduced in size two times
  and was able to move around more freely. It was rock hard before and she said
  it felt like it broke away and became soft.- The Kenyans thought there were
  between 10-15k people. We had over 1300 people respond to follow Jesus at the
  meeting.There was a woman that had stomach issues, back pain and leg pain. She
  came forward for prayer and said she felt better in all of those areas.- Over
  20,000 people approximately attended the Marani crusade to hear about Jesus,
  and approximately 1400-1500 gave their lives to the Lord.Our teachings were on
  healing, how to study the Bible, biblical finances, unity, discipleship,
  destiny and more. In both locations we held evangelistic crusades daily where
  we preached the Gospel and lead people to salvation. We saw around 3,500
  people make decisions for Christ and connect to local churches, and there were
  also 27 documented healings. We will be posting many more pictures on our
  website and Facebook soon. Your prayers and financial partnership are changing
  lives for eternity around the world, and may the Lord pour out His blessings
  upon you richly!We are so blessed to be doing what the Lord has called us to
  both here and around the world. Thank you for believing in us and joining in
  the adventure of advancing the Kingdom!

### 8.22.13  
We have made it safely to Nairobi, Kenya. All team members and luggage arrived smoothly, except the obligatory concern when one member's boarding pass was not being granted in Brussels. After multiple help desks and showing paperwork, she was able to board and the last one to enter the plane. We did not experience any issues in customs, so all of the Bibles, books, supplies and hundreds of eyeglasses were able to go through without any issues. The fire at the Nairobi airport two weeks ago has shifted the international terminal to the domestic side, and everything was set up in tents.  
Last night we stayed at the Seventh Day Adventist guest house last night, and we had a vegetarian breakfast this morning that was good.  
We are on our way to exchange our US dollars for Kenyan shillings. Our team is going to shop for souvenirs, then we have a 7 hour drive, which passes the Great River Rift Valley to our meeting in Ndhiwa tonight.
