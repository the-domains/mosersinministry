  We have 70% of our monthly budget pledged, and we are needing to raise an
  additional $1000 per month. Those that partner with us in prayer and finances
  become part of our team. If we had 10 people join us at $100 a month we would
  be fully financially supported as a couple. No gift is too small, and we are
  thankful for every donation that we have received. We are over halfway through
  2016 and we are hoping to grow our team, which is not just the Plumbline
  staff, but includes every person that is partnering with us in prayer and
  finances. If you sense that would like to join our partnership team through
  prayer or finances, please let us know. Tax-deductible contributions can be
  made through Plumbline Ministries in multiple ways to help us advance Godâ€™s
  Kingdom. Give Here
